# Replica Excel Application

This project is a replica of the popular Excel application developed using JavaScript, HTML, SCSS and code building and optimization tools.

## Description

This web application is a SPA (Single Page Application) developed in pure JavaScript without the use of frameworks or libraries. During the development process, a custom Redux-like state-management was implemented, as well as a library with application-specific methods. This library is similar in principle to jQuery. Basic unit tests have also been implemented for some components.

## Functionality

- The user can create, open and save tables and work with them almost the same way as in the original Excel.
- It is possible to edit table cells, apply a callable formula.
- Basic data operations and editing and styling.
- The user interface is designed for ease of use and intuitive navigation.

## Technologies and tools

- JavaScript: the main programming language.
- HTML and SCSS: for user interface markup and styling.
- Proprietary Redux-like stateful management.
- Proprietary library with jQuery-like methods for data manipulation.
- Webpack: basic setup for building and optimizing code.
- Jest: Used for writing basic unit tests.

## Project Goal: Improve JavaScript skills

The goal of this project was to improve my JavaScript knowledge and skills. This is not a production application, but rather a learning project designed to learn and practice the programming language. The application is a replica with basic Excel functions and the main goal was to improve my knowledge and skills in JavaScript, become more proficient and better understand the principles of web application development. I gained a lot of experience through this project.
